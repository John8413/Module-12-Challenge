pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, Credit risk classification models typically utilize historical data, financial information, credit scores, and other relevant factors to predict the probability of default or the likelihood of timely repayment. These models employ various techniques such as statistical analysis, machine learning algorithms, and data mining to identify patterns and relationships that can assist in making accurate credit risk assessments.
